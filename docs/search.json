I like to keep all my clones C:\\PROJECT-CLONES. This also makes the pathways shorter because it doesn’t inlcude your name.\n\n\nRight click in the folder and select “Git Bash Here”\n\n\n\nGit Bash window will appear with the path reflecting the path\n\n\n\nWrite the command git clone REPO_HTTPS_PATH where REPO_HTTPS_PATH is the url from step 1; press Enter\n\nNote: You can’t copy/paste using Ctr+C/Ctr+V, but you can copy/paste using Ctr+C/Shift+Insert\n\n\nA folder will appear which has the same name as the repository, all files from the repo will be download there (in this example it’s just a README.md file)\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Make Edits to Code\n\n\nGo into repository folder on machine, right click and select “Git Bash Here”\n\n\nPRIOR TO MAKING ANY EDITS PULL MOST RECENT CODE FROM REPO: git pull origin BRANCH\n\nMost often the BRANCH you will be working on is main or master. The branch you are working on will show up in blue font in parenthesis in the git bash window. Pulling the most recent code is essential for collaborative coding, this helps prevents conflicts to the code if edits are made on multiple different versions.  Example: Code on Machine Already Up-to-Date (no changes were made)   Example: Code on Machine Updated (changes to code on machine) \n\nAfter you have pulled any changes, now you can start editing your document\n\n\nAfter edits are complete, repeat step 1 to open the git bash window\n\n\nSee which files were added, edited, or deleted using git status\n\nIn this case, I have made edits to the README.md file.\n\n\nReview the changes by using git diff\n\ngit diff will show all changes for any file, if you only want to look at changes for a specific file use git diff FILE.\nRed font means that text has been deleted and green font means that text has been added.\n\n\nOnce you are comfortable with your changes you need to stage the files, or ‘add’ them so they can be committed.\n\n\n\ngit add --all will stage all files that are listed after the git status command\n\n\ngit add FILE will add only a specific file\n\n\ngit add *.R will add all files that have a .R extension (stage all R scripts)\n\n\n\nCheck that your files have been staged by using the git status command again, files that were in red font should now be in green font, indicating that they have been staged and are ready to be committed.\n\n\nCommit changes using git commit -m 'MESSAGE' where MESSAGE is a short description of the edits.\n\n\nFinally, push your commits to GitHub using git push origin BRANCH Most often the BRANCH you will be working on is main or master. Originally, the default branch was always called ‘master’. Starting in fall 2020, GitHub changed the default branch name to be ‘main’.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Simple Review\n\nPULL: git pull origin BRANCH; to update code\nEDIT: Make edits to files\nOptional: git status to view which files have changed\nOptional: git diff to view line by line changes\nSTAGE: git add --all to stage all files\nCOMMIT:git commit -m 'MESSAGE' to commit changes\nPUSH: git push origin BRANCH to send changes to GitHub so others can access"
