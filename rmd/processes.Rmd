# Common Processes 

## Rename Default Branch from Master to Main 

On GitHub's website click on <code>`r fa(name = "code-branch", fill = "var(--darkblue)")`&nbsp;#&nbsp;branches</code> icon at the top left of the code on the home page of a repository.  You should see a window that specifies all the current branches as well as the default branch. Click on the edit icon (pencil on far right) to rename a branch.  

After renaming the branch on the web interface, then go to your local clone, open bash and type in the following:  

```bash 
git branch -m master main
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/main main
git remote set-head origin -a
```
